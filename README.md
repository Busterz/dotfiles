# Dotfiles :wrench:

It's my personal dotfiles/dot-files/config files.

## Introduction

I use both Linux and MacOS. This repo serves to contain dotfiles from both OSes.

I also use VSCode on all platforms (including Windows), hence the vscode extensions installer being updated occasionally.
